Here are some simple Python apps you can build to learn programming basics, each offering hands-on experience with core concepts like variables, loops, functions, and user input:

- **To-Do List App**  
  Lets users add, remove, and manage tasks. This project teaches you about lists, functions, and handling user input[5].

- **Number Guessing Game**  
  The computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. You’ll practice loops, conditionals, and random number generation[6].

- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
  A simple game where the user plays against the computer. This project covers input handling and basic logic[2].

- **Hangman**  
  The classic word-guessing game. You’ll use loops, conditionals, and string manipulation[6].

- **Countdown Timer**  
  Create a timer that counts down from a user-specified number of seconds, teaching you about time modules and loops[3].

- **Simple Calculator**  
  Build a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. This reinforces arithmetic operations and function creation.

- **Password Generator**  
  Generate random passwords of a given length using Python’s random module[2].

- **Weather App**  
  Use an API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display current weather for a user-input city, introducing you to APIs and JSON parsing[1].

- **Word Guessing Game**  
  Similar to Hangman, but with simpler logic—guess a word one letter at a time[5].

- **Contact Address Book**  
  Store and manage contacts using dictionaries and lists[5].

These projects are beginner-friendly and help you apply Python basics in practical, fun ways. Many of them can be expanded as you learn more, adding features like saving data to files or creating a simple graphical interface[5][6].
